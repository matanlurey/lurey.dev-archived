acronyms and technology being used in this blog. In a perfect world, I&rsquo;d have
unlimited time to explain everything, but here is a quick rundown.</p><p>In the beginning, &ldquo;shared&rdquo; control of files (in this case, a TTS Save File) was
largely manual. If you&rsquo;ve worked in a professional setting for at least 10 years
you probably remember (or still see!) files like <code>TPS-REPORT-v5-FINAL.doc</code>. I
like to compare this (manual) version control to PBEM (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-mail_game>Play-by-mail game</a>),
and this is sort of the &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; first step for collaborating on a TTS mod.</p><p>At some point, you might make the jump to a shared <em>Google Drive</em> or <em>Dropbox</em>
(or whatever is the hotness right now in shared file hosting), perhaps with a
fancy auto-synchronization rule. This alleviates the need to explicitly share
(and receive) updates for the mod, but isn&rsquo;t truly collaborative - it ends up
being a locking-style of version control, where effectively only one person can
make edits at a time.</p><p>Using a version control system (source control) like <a href=https://git-scm.com/>Git</a> or <a href=https://www.mercurial-scm.org/>Mercurial</a>
provides a lot of additional benefits - you can see the history of files, you
can revert (sometimes called &ldquo;rollback&rdquo;) to earlier versions, and, if done well,
you can often make simultaneous edits to the same file(s), especially ones that
are mostly human-readable (think: text files, not images or binary files).</p><p>Additionally, there are existing popular communities, like <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a>, where
you can host your source code for free, and use a lot of free web-based tools
to collaborate. For example, NASA (yes, <em>the</em> NASA) hosts their Open MCT
dashboard on GitHub: <a href=https://github.com/nasa/openmct>https://github.com/nasa/openmct</a>.</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168174/111923604-31618b80-8a5d-11eb-80af-772bc8c7af37.png alt="History of OpenMCT"></p><h2 id=the-problems-with-source-control-and-tts>The problems with source control and TTS</h2><p>If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, you might be asking yourself - OK, that all sounds
interesting - or maybe if you a prior user of Git/GitHub might not understand
exactly why Tabletop Simulator is <em>not</em> a natural fit. Well, that&rsquo;s because of
the <em>save file format</em> of TTS itself - it&rsquo;s a huge monolithic JSON file.</p><p>Here are the first ~30 or so lines of over 50K lines of the mod I maintain:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-json data-lang=json>{

<a href=https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>feature branching</a> as a strategy) are working on the mod concurrently, you
now have a problem - how can you tell if an edit is incompatible with another
one? For a while, the answer was &ldquo;I did it manually&rdquo;. This was a rough process,
and often required patching, re-patching, manual testing, and sometimes even
partial rewrites of contributed features.</p><p>Despite adding 2 more developers to our open source team we were spending more
and more time merging changes and less and less time contributing features and
bug fixes:</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168174/111923817-41c63600-8a5e-11eb-999f-bc920c0398d0.png alt="A typical edit"></p><p>So, I developed a system of free open-source NodeJS packages to try and solve
our workflow problems, and to work collaboratively on GitHub, together, like
a typical open source project. I went through many iterations, and landed on
a series of disjoint packages.</p><blockquote><p>🔥 <strong>Why NodeJS?</strong></p><p>The short answer is I wanted to choose a language (JavaScript) where I thought
non-developers would have the best chance of understanding and using what I
made - that meant &ldquo;fun&rdquo; languages like Rust/Go/Kotlin were all out of
question.</p><p>If you like my approach, but have a favorite language you&rsquo;d like to write
tools in know that nothing here <em>requires</em> JavaScript (or Node), but of course
if you want use my packages as-is you&rsquo;ll need them.</p></blockquote><h2 id=enter-tts-save-files--tts-expander>Enter <code>tts-save-files</code> & <code>tts-expander</code></h2><p>The first package I developed was called <a href=https://github.com/matanlurey/tts-save-format><code>tts-save-files</code></a>.

honest, the most boring package - I created a series of JSON Schema files to

standalone <code>.json</code> (and <code>.lua</code>) files, in a directory structure that mirrors
the original file, and retains some extra metadata:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-json data-lang=json>{

other part of the mod.</p><p>The tooling also provides the reverse functionality - taking a directory of
&ldquo;split&rdquo; files and combining (&ldquo;compiling&rdquo;) them back into the single JSON file
format the Tabletop Simulator expects. In our mod, you use <code>npm run compile</code>.</p><p>With this approach, we now are able to collaborate and merge code without
coordinating on who is making edits (at least, generally speaking), and it works
a lot more like a typical open source project - we don&rsquo;t even store the &ldquo;full&rdquo;

</code></pre></div><p>Currently I use this library to automatically &ldquo;reload&rdquo; the mod on compile!</p><h2 id=some-unsolved-problems>Some unsolved problems</h2><p>I wish I could end with saying &ldquo;here is a bullet-proof way of making a mod&rdquo; with
a simple template others could follow for success. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t have
the free time (yet) to do this, but I&rsquo;m hoping the steps in this blog can be
followed by others, and I&rsquo;m also happy to answer questions about it on
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/decafmatan>Reddit</a> or <a href=mailto:blog@lurey.dev>via email</a>.
Some unsolved problems I&rsquo;d like to still resolve:</p><ul><li><p>TTS (and Unity) floating point numbers - whenever the save file is edited by
TTS itself, floating point numbers will change - just a tiny bit - across the
entire mod. These can normally just be ignored, but I&rsquo;d love to build a script
to do this automatically.</p></li><li><p>A way to run TTS, headless, on GitHub actions - I want to be able to, on every
PR, take a screenshot or screen-cast of the mod running. This would add a nice
low-bar test for contributions.</p></li><li><p>A standard Lua formatter that I can run on the command-line.</p></li></ul></div><div class=article-info><div class=article-date>2021-03-21</div><div class=article-taxonomies></div></div></article></main><footer><p>© Matan Lurey, 2021<br>Powered by <a target=_blank href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, theme <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis>Anubis</a>.</p></footer></div></body></html>
