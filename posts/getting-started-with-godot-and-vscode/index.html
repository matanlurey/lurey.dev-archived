scoop install godot-mono
scoop install mono
</code></pre></div><p>A few minutes later, Godot and Mono were installed. You can also install them
with <code>.exe</code> installers available on their site, but that&rsquo;s totally your choice.
I already had <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/>VSCode</a> installed, but if you don&rsquo;t have it, I recommend it.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll need the following <em>extensions</em> for VSCode:</p><ul><li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp">C# for Visual Studio Code</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.mono-debug">Mono Debug</a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geequlim.godot-tools">Godot Tools</a></li></ul><h2 id=create-a-new-project>Create a new project</h2><p>Open the <em>Godot Editor</em>, and hit <strong>New Project</strong>. I called mine
<code>GodotRogueDemo</code>.</p><p>I did nothing else within the <em>Godot Editor</em>, and then opened the newly created
folder in VSCode, and hit <code>F1</code> - this opens the quick launcher for VSCode, and
I typed <strong>Godot > Godot Tools: Open workspace with Godot Editor</strong>.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll then need, once, to tell the VSCode extension where <em>Godot</em> is installed.
Fortunately due to using <code>scoop</code>, this is a canonical location - so for me it
was <code>C:\Users\Matan\scoop\apps\godot-mono\current\godot.exe</code>, but you might have
it installed elsewhere.</p><h2 id=create-a-scene-and-sprite>Create a scene and sprite</h2><p>I created a new 2D scene, and dragged an instance of <code>icon.png</code> over, and then
hit <strong>Right Click -> Attach Script</strong>, and chose <strong>C#</strong>. The script ending up
looking like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-cs data-lang=cs><span style=color:#66d9ef>using</span> Godot;

<span style=color:#66d9ef>public</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>class</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>Icon</span> : Sprite
{
  <span style=color:#66d9ef>public</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>override</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>void</span> _Ready()
  {
    GD.Print(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Hello World&#34;</span>);
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>To make debugging available in VSCode, I went, in the Godot Editor, to
<strong>Project > Project Settings</strong>, scrolled down to <strong>Mono > Debugger Agent</strong>, and
enabled the checkbox <strong>Wait for Debugger</strong>. I also bumped the timeout to <code>10000</code>
and copied the port to reference in VSCode (mine was <code>23685</code>).</p><p>Back into VSCode, I went into the <strong>Run and Debug</strong> menu, and created a new
configuration for <strong>C# Mono</strong> - my <code>launch.json</code> looks like this, but yours will
likely look very similar:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-json data-lang=json>{

</code></pre></div><p>Save your scene and script, and now it is possible to launch your Godot demo
project, and attach the debugger from VSCode. This isn&rsquo;t a completely seamless
experience (I&rsquo;m hoping to mess around with <code>launch.json</code> more in the near future
and create a specific &ldquo;debug&rdquo; task that automates much of this), but it works!</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168174/111084722-090fe500-84d1-11eb-891e-ddf1d8fd2390.png alt=Demo></p></div><div class=article-info><div class=article-date>2021-03-14</div><div class=article-taxonomies></div></div></article></main><footer><p>Â© Matan Lurey, 2021<br>Powered by <a target=_blank href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, theme <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis>Anubis</a>.</p></footer></div></body></html>
