permanent WFH (&ldquo;work from home&rdquo;), and I&rsquo;ve decided to take the opportunity to
restart my blog. I&rsquo;ve had a blog in the past, and used it to talk about tech,
politics, and nerd culture, but I haven&rsquo;t maintained anything serious in years.</p><p>I think writing a blog will help me focus on my side projects - giving me a
reason to have something close to &ldquo;deliverables&rdquo; (i.e. I need to be able to
produce <em>something</em> visible to be able to blog about it), as well as an outlet
to write on something that isn&rsquo;t Twitter or personal Discord(s).</p><p>Originally I thought about creating separate blogs for separate topics, but I
want to reduce the barrier of me writing to an absolute minimum - my goal here
isn&rsquo;t to get a hundred readers, I just want to write a hundred posts. So if
you&rsquo;re reading this (thanks!), know that I am unlikely to be consistent, but
will try to &ldquo;tag&rdquo; content to make it skip-able.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in how I&rsquo;m developing this blog - it&rsquo;s fairly simple but
does require a bit of a technical background - e.g. more than creating an
account on <a href=https://www.blogger.com/>Blogger</a> or (ugh) <a href=https://medium.com/>Medium</a>. I&rsquo;m using <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, a self-hosted
site-generation platform that uses <a href=https://www.markdownguide.org/>Markdown</a> files and in my case, is hosted
directly on <a href=https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/>Github Pages</a>.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in creating your own similar blog, take a look at the <a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/>Hugo &ldquo;Quick Start&rdquo;</a>.
