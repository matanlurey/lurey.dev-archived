A little known fact is that [Darth Vader][], the primary antagonist in the
original Star Wars trilogy (and a primary protagonist in the prequel trilogy)
has been referred to by no other than George Lucas as the centerpoint of the
first six films - as ["the tragedy of Darth Vader"][].

In [Star Wars Legion][], Fantasy Flight Games most successful foray into
a tabletop miniatures game, Vader was the first commander created for the
Galactic Empire faction, and one of the most iconic looking units in the game:

Unfortunately, the terrifying looking Dark Lord just doesn't deliver in the game
and this blog will go more into why Darth Vader (as of time of this writing,
October 2020) falls short of a competitive piece.

Is this a now familiar sight to Vader players? Hiding behind a terrain piece,
wounded to brink of defeat, terrified of units that cost a third as much of the
Sith? If it _isn't_, then please invite me to your next game night once COVID
is over.

Let's take a look at _Commander_ Vader's unit card, stats, and command cards
(_note that all images and content are copyright Fantasy Flight
Games/Disney/etc_ and are for reference purposes only):

![Commander Darth Vader in Star Wars Legion](/darth-vader-unit-card.png)

At _8_ wounds, _3_ force upgrade slots, `Master of the Force`, `Relentless`, and
a dizzying 6-red attack with `Impact: 3` and `Pierce: 3`, and _infinite_
courage; Darth Vader has some of the strongest individual stats in the game.
Plus, Vader has access to **six** command cards, one of two units in the game
(Luke Skywalker is the other) that can do so.

**However**, there are two elements that keep Lord Vader on the asthmatic
old-dude side of most competitive games: _army synergy_ and
_individual impact in typical games_. Let's start with the latter.

## Individual Impact

Vader is one of those units commonly referred to as "high ceiling, low floor",
which means the _potential_ ability for Darth Vader to infleunce the game is
extremely high - a few 6 dice pierce 3 attacks can (hypothetically) table an
opponent:

On the flip side, Vader is somewhat unique in that his ability to do
_next to nothing_ is _also_ high. This has a two-progned effect on the game -
when selecting an army, Darth Vader is the hardest _individual_ core-box
commander to play (see [comparisons](#comparisons)), and _thematically_ he
plays quite different from what you'd probably expect.

{{< figure src="/reagan-raptor.jpg" caption="Meanwhile, Rebel Tauntaun Riders play more like this." >}}

First, what does 6 red, without any surge tokens or surge to crit, look like? In
melee, Vader averages (`6/8 * 6`) 4.5 _hits_, and with `Pierce: 3` is almost
always [guaranteed to _land_ those hits as wounds](https://rollcrits.com/6r/impact:3,pierce:3,surge:blank/?iterations=10000&defenders=standard&randomSeed=wjXnIXhU8I):

![Vader is landing usually between 2 and 3 guaranteed wounds](/vader-doing-wounds.png)

And that looks extremely good, until you realize that it's only in melee, and
you have one of two of the _only_ `Speed: 1` units in the game (the other being
[Emperor Palpatine](#palpatine)). So your standard threat range looks like this:

{{< figure src="/vader-two-moves.png" caption="A bit shy of 8 inches" >}}

You can read [Mike Barry's excellent analysis](https://thefifthtrooper.com/darth-vader-dark-lord-of-the-sith/)
for some more details, as well as how to slightly extend Vader's range and
threat with _Force Push_, but this blog is primarily about Vader _in comparison_
to other commanders, so I won't expand further. Needless to say, it's certainly
_possible_ to get Vader up the field and into melee where he wants to be - but
it's _not easy_, _not intuitive_, and doesn't _feel like_ a Dark Lord of the
Sith.

{{< figure src="/vader-being-pulled.png" caption="What it typically feels like playing Darth Vader" >}}

Let's jump into his command cards next, as a big component of why you would
bring a Commander or Operative over several smaller hitters is (ostensibly) the
value of their _command cards_ - a big component of the game of Legion.

## Command Cards

### Implacable

{{< figure src="/vader/1-pip-implacable.png" caption="Implacable: I just treat this card as Ambush with a gambling mechanic" >}}

I _think_ `Implacable` is supposed to represent Darth Vader making his way
through the Tantive IV, or perhaps even this
[iconic scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxL8bVJhXCM) from Rogue One. It
is a fairly standard 1-pip, giving Vader a coin-flip's chance at going first
against an adversary (well, except for [Count Dooku](#dooku) or
[Emperor Palpatine](#palpatine) or Director Krennic).

Then, once you've completed your activation and have an otherwise full bag of
order tokens (likely between 8 and 9, unless you've already lost several
activations and are on your way to losing the game), you can _suffer a wound_
to have a 1/9th, 1/8th, 1/7th, 1/6th (etc) chance of drawing Darth Vader and
getting the opportunity to go again.

In practice, I think this was supposed to incentivize holding Vader until later
in the round (to incrase the chance of pulling his token quickly and going twice
in a row), but it's not typically what you want with a 1-pip, and suffering a
wound on your most important piece to do this adds further insult to injury.

### Vader's Might

{{< figure src="/vader/1-pip-vaders-might.png" caption="Vader's Might: Probably Vader's single best offensive command card" >}}

`Vader's Might` is an outright terrifying card for your opponent:

- It can extend Vader's range by 6 inches ("range 1") to land an attack
- It can hurl units away from an objective, or friendly units towards one.
- It can act as a "disengage" for Vader, freeing up the rest of his actions.

If you are taking Darth Vader, this is a must-take card (and unfortunately that
also means you need to buy the [Darth Vader Operative Expansion][] in order to
play it competitively). I don't have anything negative to say about this card,
and if Vader had additional cards similar to this one I wouldn't have written
this article.

### New Ways to Motivate Them

{{< figure src="/vader/2-pip-new-ways.png" caption="New Ways to Motivate Them: Powerful, but very situational" >}}

One of the nicest parts about `New Ways to Motivate Them` is that it _doesn't_
require an order on the commander, which is fairly rare for most expensive named
units, and it doesn't have a maximum effect, meaning you could double up with
[HQ Uplink][] or other upgrades or effects that issue additional orders.

This card is best played as a way to efficiently interact with an objective
(interact, move, move or move, interact, move or move, move, interact) or as a
way for a multiwound unit like [Imperial Royal Guards][], [Dewback Riders][],
or even [Bossk][] to increase their threat range.

The downside? None of those units are particularly cheap, and you end up relying
on multiple units (and Vader) being positioned well, and that your opponent does
not have an obvious counters (or a cache of standby tokens).

It's worth nearly always taking this card, but getting a peak benefit from it is
(in my opinion) more difficult than the benefit gained by comparable units.

### Fear and Dead Men

{{< figure src="/vader/2-pip-fear-and-dead-men.png" caption="Fear and Dead Men: Good at first sight, but ultimately sort of meh" >}}

The first time I read `Fear and Dead Men`, I was extremely excited: finally a
way for Darth Vader to get his own cache of dodge tokens, and even a more
powerful `Deflect` as a result - neat! So what's the problem(s)?

- You need to be within range 2 of units for this to do anything; unlike Luke's
  2 pips (both of them), this doesn't offer your help engaging - it's a card
  that is only going to do (much) of anything if you've made it into close
  range already.
- Some of the scariest units in the game easily operate at range 3 or 4,
  completely bypassing any sort of security you'd get by playing this card.
- For a 2 pip, it's quite rare to get _zero control_ over the rest of your
  army (more on that later in [army synergy](#synergy)).
- Effects that only come into play when you take wounds are a mixed bag; an
  opponent is going to be _elated_ if they land a wound or two on Vader and
  suffer 2 wounds on say, Tauntaun Riders or B1 Battle Droids.

Fear and Dead Men is a situational card that is likely better suited as `Push`
in some lists (or other 2-pips when you manage to fit in another named unit
like [Iden Versio][] or [Bossk][]).
