It's a few months into the COVID 19 quarantine, where I'm perpetually stuck in
permanent WFH ("work from home"), and I've decided to take the opportunity to
restart my blog. I've had a blog in the past, and used it to talk about tech,
politics, and nerd culture, but I haven't maintained anything serious in years.

I think writing a blog will help me focus on my side projects - giving me a
reason to have something close to "deliverables" (i.e. I need to be able to
produce _something_ visible to be able to blog about it), as well as an outlet
to write on something that isn't Twiter or personal Discord(s).

Originally I thought about creating separate blogs for separate topics, but I
want to reduce the barrier of me writing to an absolute minimum - my goal here
isn't to get a hundred readers, I just want to write a hundred posts. So if
you're reading this (thanks!), know that I am unlikely to be consistent, but
will try to "tag" content to make it skippable.

If you're interested in how I'm developing this blog - it's fairly simple but
does require a bit of a technical background - e.g. more than creating an
account on [Blogger][] or (ugh) [Medium][]. I'm using [Hugo], a self-hosted
site-generation platform that uses [Markdown][] files and in my case, is hosted
directly on [Github Pages][].

If you're interested in creating your own similar blog, take a look at the [Hugo "Quick Start"]. Cheers!
