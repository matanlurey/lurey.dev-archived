Who else started learning trigonometry during the COVID-19 quarantine?

I've been learning [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) in order to work on mods for
[Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/). One such mod is for a
popular tabletop minatures game, where it was important to determine distance
(range) from a completely 2D-horizontal perspective even though the game itself
had 3D models and terrain, which immediately became a challenge.
