capacity for almost <strong>2</strong> years now. For those not familiar, Star Wars Legion is
a fairly complex tabletop miniatures game somewhat similar to Warhammer 40K and
similar titles - it is a quasi turn-based tactical game with <em>lots</em> of rules,
tokens, minis, and various fiddly bits.</p><p><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/168174/111917323-922c9c00-8a3c-11eb-8508-f7f0027ccebc.png alt="An example of the game in action"></p><p>One of the goals originally for this project was that I wanted it to be as
collaborative as possible - i.e. be able to support multiple different people
contributing in different capacities - including scripting and re-designing the
table.</p><p>However, I quickly found out that having more than one person making edits to
a monolithic (at the time, 20Mb) JSON file (the format of save files/mod files
for Tabletop Simulator) was not scaling, and, as a result, designed a whole
custom system of tools that I wanted to share with the community.</p></div><div class=article-info><div class=article-date>2021-03-21</div><div class=article-taxonomies></div></div></article><article class=post-list><header><h1><a href=/posts/getting-started-with-godot-and-vscode/>Getting Started With Godot and VSCode</a></h1></header><div class=content><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote anything: it&rsquo;s not that I haven&rsquo;t been writing,
but rather I&rsquo;ve created a split-off community-run blog for Star Wars: Legion,
and it&rsquo;s taken a bit of time to want to come back to general blogging.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about creating a new game/project, mostly as a learning
experience, and partially as something to do during this perpetual WFH period.
Instead of reflexively falling back on a technology I&rsquo;m comfortable with (i.e.
React/TSX or Dart/Flutter), I&rsquo;ve decided to try out <a href=https://godotengine.org/>Godot</a>, an open source
and full-featured game engine with both 2D and 3D support.</p><p>Of course, I wasn&rsquo;t fully satisfied with learning or using <a href=https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html>GDScript</a> - it
seems interesting enough, but I wanted to use a statically typed high-level
language, and I wanted to use VSCode - so this is a good opportunity for <a href=https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/index.html>C#</a>.</p></div><div class=article-info><div class=article-date>2021-03-14</div><div class=article-taxonomies></div></div></article><article class=post-list><header><h1><a href=/posts/welcome/>A New Hope</a></h1></header><div class=content><p><img src=/lego_landspeeder.jpg alt="Lego Star Wars Landspeeder"></p><p>It&rsquo;s a few months into the COVID 19 quarantine, where I&rsquo;m perpetually stuck in
permanent WFH (&ldquo;work from home&rdquo;), and I&rsquo;ve decided to take the opportunity to
restart my blog. I&rsquo;ve had a blog in the past, and used it to talk about tech,
politics, and nerd culture, but I haven&rsquo;t maintained anything serious in years.</p></div><div class=article-info><div class=article-date>2020-08-07</div><div class=article-taxonomies></div></div></article></main><footer><p>Â© Matan Lurey, 2021<br>Powered by <a target=_blank href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, theme <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis>Anubis</a>.</p></footer></div></body></html>
